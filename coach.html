					Guardiola played as a defensive midfielder and spent the majority of his career with Barcelona, forming a part of Johan Cruyff's "Dream Team" that won the club's first European Cup in 1992, and four successive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. He later captained the team from 1997 to 2001. He then played for Brescia and Roma in Italy, Al-Ahli in Qatar, and Dorados de Sinaloa in Mexico while training to be a manager. While playing in Italy, he served a four-month ban for a positive drug test, although he was cleared of wrongdoing twice on appeal in 2009 before the Courts of Justice of the Italian Football Federation and the Federal Anti-Doping Courts of the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI). Guardiola was capped 47 times for Spain, winning the Olympic Gold Medal in 1992, and appeared at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He also played friendly matches for Catalonia. <a href="#pep">read more...</a>

					Martino was assigned as head coach of the Paraguayan national football team in February 2007, replacing Uruguayan Anibal "Maño" Ruiz. His knowledge and success while coaching Paraguayan clubs were the parameters that positioned him as the best option for the job (other candidates were Nery Pumpido and Miguel Ángel Russo). Previously, Martino had won the Paraguayan league four times from 2002 till 2006. In 2008, Martino was linked for vacant managerial position of Iran Pro League side Steel Azin but the deal was cancelled due to personal reasons. On 5 July 2010, Martino announced that he would be stepping down as Paraguay coach on their return from the 2010 FIFA World Cup in which he led Paraguay to quarter-finals. Martino confirmed that with his four-year contract expiring, he would not be extending his spell in charge of the national side. However, on 10 July 2010, Martino agreed to stay on as Paraguay coach until after the 2011 Copa America, in which Paraguay were runners-up after losing to Uruguay in the final. <a href="#ger">read more...</a>

					Vilanova started his coaching career in 2003–04, being in charge of Tercera División side FC Palafrugell and suffering relegation to Primera Catalana. After working as technical director at Terrassa FC he was appointed assistant manager at FC Barcelona, under manager Pep Guardiola, with the club in the fourth level. In the summer of 2008, after leading the reserve side to promotion to Segunda División B, Vilanova and Guardiola were assigned to the Barcelona first team, replacing Dutch duo Frank Rijkaard and Johan Neeskens. His first season at the Camp Nou was the most successful in Barcelona's history, with the club winning six major trophies and becoming the first in Spain to win the Copa del Rey, league and UEFA Champions League titles in the same season. On 27 April 2012, at the press conference in which Barcelona confirmed Guardiola's departure, it was also announced that Vilanova would be his successor.[9] On 15 June he signed a two-year contract, and the team went on to lose only eight competitive games during the season. <a href="#vila">read more...</a>
